# SENTRA
### AI Policy Governance & Decision Intelligence Platform

SENTRA is an AI-powered internal decision-support system designed to help organizations
evaluate workplace decisions against official policy documents before execution.

## Problem Statement
Organizational policies (HR, security, conduct, remote work, etc.) are often lengthy
and complex. Employees and managers frequently misinterpret these policies, leading to
unintentional violations, disputes, and compliance risks.

Existing AI tools provide generic answers but lack policy grounding, explainability,
and risk awareness.

## What SENTRA Does
SENTRA analyzes real-world workplace decision scenarios using official policy documents
and provides:
- Policy-grounded evaluation
- Compliance risk classification (Low / Medium / High)
- Clear reasoning with policy references
- Safer, policy-compliant alternatives when applicable

This system is designed as a **decision intelligence platform**, not a generic chatbot.
